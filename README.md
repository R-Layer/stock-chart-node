# FCC project - Graph the stock market

Used Node, socket.io, zingchart to build the app. 
Used Quandl_api, iextrading to collect the data.

It works ( even if it is really slow).


User stories:
 - [x] User Story: I can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
 - [x] User Story: I can add new stocks by their symbol name.
 - [x] User Story: I can remove stocks.
 - [x] User Story: I can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
